## The Role of AI in Transitional Justice: Addressing Past Wrongs, Building a Better Future

### Introduction

Transitional justice is a crucial process for addressing past human rights violations promoting reconciliation and building sustainable  peace. Artificial intelligence  (AI) is rapidly evolving and has the potential to transform various sectors, including transitional justice. This article explores the role of AI in  transitional justice, examining  its capacity to address past wrongs and facilitate  a better future.

### AI in Transitional Justice: Opportunities and Challenges

AI offers several opportunities for transitional justice processes. Firstly, it  can assist in the collection and analysis of vast amounts of  data related to past  human rights violations. AI-powered algorithms can sift through archives, testimonies, and other records to identify  patterns, connections, and evidence that would  be difficult or impossible for humans to find. This can help establish the truth about past events and identify perpetrators.

Secondly AI can contribute to the preservation of memory and  the creation of comprehensive  historical records. AI-driven systems can digitize and catalog documents audio-visual materials, and other  artifacts related to past human  rights abuses. This digital preservation  ensures  that  future generations can access and learn from these historical records promoting remembrance and preventing  the recurrence of  past atrocities.

Thirdly,  AI can facilitate victim  participation and access to justice. AI-powered platforms can provide victims with secure and accessible channels to share their experiences, seek support, and engage in transitional justice processes. AI-driven systems can also assist in the  provision of reparations and compensation to  victims ensuring that they receive justice and support in a  timely and efficient manner.

However, the use of AI in transitional justice also poses several challenges. One concern is the potential for AI systems  to perpetuate or amplify biases and discrimination. AI algorithms trained on biased data can make unfair or inaccurate decisions leading to further injustice and marginalization. Additionally, the  lack  of transparency and accountability in AI systems can make it difficult to identify and address these biases.

### AI Applications  in Transitional Justice: Real-World Examples

Despite these challenges, AI is already being used in various transitional justice  initiatives around the world. One notable example is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, which used  AI  to organize and analyze over 20,000 testimonies from victims of apartheid. This enabled the commission to create  a comprehensive record of human rights violations and facilitate  reconciliation efforts.

In Guatemala, AI has been employed to digitize  and preserve historical records related to the country's civil war. The "Nunca MÃ¡s"  (Never Again)  project has collected over 80,000 documents, including  testimonies, court records and photographs, and made  them accessible through an AI-powered online archive.  This digital repository serves as a valuable resource  for researchers victims, and the general  public.

AI is also playing a role in promoting  victim participation  and access to justice. In Colombia the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL) has developed an  AI-powered platform called "Acceso a la  Justicia" (Access to Justice). This platform provides victims of human rights violations with information legal advice and support in  accessing justice mechanisms. Through AI-driven natural language processing, the platform can analyze  victims' testimonies and identify key legal issues, facilitating the  provision  of targeted assistance.

### AI and the Building  of a Better Future

AI holds  immense potential for transitional justice processes and can significantly contribute  to addressing past wrongs and  building a better future.  As AI continues to evolve it is crucial to  address the challenges and concerns associated with  its use in transitional justice. By developing ethical guidelines, fostering transparency and accountability and promoting inclusive and participatory approaches, we can harness the  power of AI to facilitate healing, reconciliation, and lasting peace.

Transitional justice is a complex and challenging process  but it is essential  for building sustainable peace and preventing future atrocities.  AI has emerged as a powerful tool that can assist in this process by addressing  past wrongs, preserving memory, facilitating victim participation,  and promoting reconciliation.  By  harnessing the potential  of AI while mitigating its risks we can create a more just and equitable future for  all.
